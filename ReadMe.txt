In this assignment, you only need to use the provided executables in order to test your vertex and fragment shaders.

  LightTest.exe - for Windows machines
  LightTest-linux - for Linux-based machines

These programs assume that the files 'light.vert' and 'light.frag' are in the same folder.  The shader programs will be read-in and uploaded to the GPU.  An attempt is then made to compile and link the shaders.


Program controls.
  - Left mouse click sets the spot light location.
  - Space bar sets the parameter editing mode (light radius, light factor, ambient factor)
  - Up/down arrows increase/decrease the parameter that is being edited.
